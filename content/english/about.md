Hi! <br/>

I am a graduate student at Renmin University of China, majoring in International Journalism and Communication.<br/>

My research interests mainly lie at the intersection of social media use and popular culture, with a particular focus on fandom. I have a strong interest in examining the impact of popular culture audiences' online engagement within the East Asian context on their political attitudes and fostering transcultural communication among China, South Korea, and Japan. Besides, I am also interested in research related to Journalism and media industry. My ongoing master's thesis is about the news value of an international newspaper in China, using computational methods.<br/>
