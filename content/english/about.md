Hi! <br/>

I am a graduate student at Renmin University of China, majoring in International Journalism and Communication.<br/>

My research interests mainly lie at the intersection of social media and popular culture, with a particular focus on fandom. I have a strong interest in examining the impact of popular culture audiences' online engagement on their political attitudes and fostering transcultural communication within the East Asian context. Besides, I am also interested in research related to international journalism and media industry. My ongoing master's thesis is about the news value of an international newspaper in China, using computational methods.<br/>
