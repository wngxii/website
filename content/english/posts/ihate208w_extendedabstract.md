> This is an extended abstract submitted to the Popular Culture Working Group of [IAMCR2023](https://iamcr.org/lyon2023).<br/>

"208w" is the abbreviation for 2.08 million yuan (about $300,000) in Chinese. "208w" is widely used on Chinese social media to refer to high-earning popular celebrities since Chinese actress Zheng Shuang, who allegedly evaded taxes, was exposed that she was paid approximately 2.08 million yuan per day during filming. Unlike anti-fans who target specific celebrities or media productions, some social media users use "208w" to generally express their hate speech or critique of popular celebrities.<br/> 

Combining discourse analysis and in-depth interviews, this study tries to answer the following questions: What specifically are social media users expressing when they engage in anti-celebrity discursive resistance? Is there a conflict between anti-celebrity discursive resistance behavior and their identity and consumption behavior as popular culture audiences? This study crawled over 30,000 Weibo posts with "208w" as the keyword and analyzed the texts through LDA model and sentiment analysis. To deepen understanding of the relationship between anti-celebrity discourse and popular culture consumption, this study also conducted one-on-one interviews with 8 Weibo users who used "208w" to refer to popular celebrities and post hate speech or critique.<br/>

The paper summarized Weibo users' anti-celebrity discourse into five topic categories: jealousy and hatred of celebrities' high income, critiquing and resistance of celebrities' illegal and inappropriate behaviors, critiquing and mockery of privileges enjoyed by celebrities, body shaming and appearance judgment of celebrities, and mockery and resistance of celebrity fans. Most Weibo users who engage in anti-celebrity discursive resistance are popular culture audiences, including many who were once ardent fans of certain popular celebrities. While engaging in celebrity critiquing, they negotiate their identity as popular culture consumers by watching pirated videos and refusing to buy merchandise endorsed by specific celebrities. The anti-celebrity discourse on social media sometimes also conspires with Chinese official media to cause substantial negative effects on specific celebrities.<br/>

The paper argues that the anti-celebrity discursive resistance of popular culture audiences is a microcosm of the discursive resistance to privilege and elites in Chinese cyber-populism. The paper also discussed Chinese consumers' collective imagination toward popular celebrities.<br/>
