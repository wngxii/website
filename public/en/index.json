Unlike anti-fans who target specific celebrities or media productions, some social media users use \u0026ldquo;208w\u0026rdquo; to generally express their hate speech or critique of popular celebrities.\nCombining discourse analysis and in-depth interviews, this study tries to answer the following questions: What specifically are social media users expressing when they engage in anti-celebrity discursive resistance? Is there a conflict between anti-celebrity discursive resistance behavior and their identity and consumption behavior as popular culture audiences? This study crawled over 30,000 Weibo posts with \u0026ldquo;208w\u0026rdquo; as the keyword and analyzed the texts through LDA model and sentiment analysis. To deepen understanding of the relationship between anti-celebrity discourse and popular culture consumption, this study also conducted one-on-one interviews with 8 Weibo users who used \u0026ldquo;208w\u0026rdquo; to refer to popular celebrities and post hate speech or critique.\nThe paper summarized Weibo users\u0026rsquo; anti-celebrity discourse into five topic categories: jealousy and hatred of celebrities\u0026rsquo; high income, critiquing and resistance of celebrities\u0026rsquo; illegal and inappropriate behaviors, critiquing and mockery of privileges enjoyed by celebrities, body shaming and appearance judgment of celebrities, and mockery and resistance of celebrity fans. Most Weibo users who engage in anti-celebrity discursive resistance are popular culture audiences, including many who were once ardent fans of certain popular celebrities. While engaging in celebrity critiquing, they negotiate their identity as popular culture consumers by watching pirated videos and refusing to buy merchandise endorsed by specific celebrities. The anti-celebrity discourse on social media sometimes also conspires with Chinese official media to cause substantial negative effects on specific celebrities.\nThe paper argues that the anti-celebrity discursive resistance of popular culture audiences is a microcosm of the discursive resistance to privilege and elites in Chinese cyber-populism. The paper also discussed Chinese consumers\u0026rsquo; collective imagination toward popular celebrities.\nKEYWORDS: anti-celebrity, popular culture audience, discursive analysis, social media, cyber-populism\n","permalink":"https://wangxi.netlify.app/en/posts/ihate208w_extendedabstract/","summary":"This is an extended abstract submitted to the Popular Culture Working Group of IAMCR2023. \u0026ldquo;208w\u0026rdquo; is the abbreviation for 2.08 million yuan (about $300,000) in Chinese. \u0026ldquo;208w\u0026rdquo; is widely used on Chinese social media to refer to high-earning popular celebrities since Chinese actress Zheng Shuang, who allegedly evaded taxes, was exposed that she was paid approximately 2.08 million yuan per day during filming.

Social media is an important platform for ACG fans to communicate with their peers and self-present themselves. Investigating self-presentation on social media is crucial since it is a powerful predictor of social media attachment and addiction, which is the stereotype of the ACG fan community (Chen, 2019). As enthusiasts of virtual worlds, ACG fans are active on multiple social media platforms. How do ACG fans present their identities when using different social media? What are the factors that influence their self-presentation on social media?\nThis study conducted in-depth interviews with 10 participants to investigate their self-presentation strategies on different social media platforms and influencing factors. All interviewees regarded themselves as enthusiastic ACG fans. Their average time immersed in the ACG culture was more than ten years. Each interviewee used at least five social media simultaneously.\nThe paper first found that ACG fans adopt different self-presentation strategies on different social media to make their fan identities appear ‚Äúfloating‚Äù. ACG fans selectively use social media for different needs. They use diverse social media when socializing with peers, expressing their emotions, obtaining ACG-related information, and watching ACG-related videos. They adopt different strategies in presenting profile photos, user names, memes, etc. They present themselves as ACG fans on some social media platforms and do not present themselves as such on others.\nThe paper then found that the contribution of the identity of the ACG fan community to the positive aspects of the users‚Äô social identity, the motivation for using certain social media, and individual personality characteristics are the factors that affect the differential strategies of cross-social media self-presentation. Most interviewees don‚Äôt present much of their ACG fan identities on the acquaintance platform like WeChat. The self-presentation of ACG fan identities is still largely within the ACG fan community and on social media platforms filled with strangers. Due to personality characteristics, ACG fans sometimes present ‚Äúanti-social‚Äù states on social media.\nThe paper also explored the divergences within the ACG fan community and their influence on members‚Äô identities. The diverse strategies of self-presentation, which vary according to the target audience, are partly a result of the stigmatization of ACG culture and the divergences within the ACG fan community. From the perspective of the three aspects of identity, ACG fans mainly identify themselves as fans on the emotional aspect, rather than necessarily identify themselves in the cognitive aspect of belonging to the ACG fan community and the behavioral aspect of self-presentation on social media (Sun, 2018).\nStudying the self-presentation of the ACG fan community on different social media is helpful for us to understand the relationship between identity and the self-presentation of specific groups.\nKEYWORDS: Self-presentation, social media, ACG culture, fan community, social identity\nReferencesÔºö Chen, A.
